![](/screenshot/sample1.png?raw=true "Opened Popover") ![](/screenshot/sample2.png?raw=true "Two Bubbles and Popover")

Usage
============
There are two main widgets which you can use:

- `ChipsEditText` for editable text and bubbles with `AutocompletePopover`.
- `ChipsTextView` if you plan only on displaying non-editable text with bubbles and optionally wish to provide some feedback on bubble press.

Including in your project
=========================

I still doesn't upload to sonatype and made it gradle-responsible dependencie, so, by now, just clone into a libraries folder and add as a dependencie manually from Android Studio or Eclipse.
